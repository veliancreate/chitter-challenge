Chitter Challenge
=================

## Tech used

Ruby, Sinatra, Postgreql, DataMapper, Rspec/Capybara, CSS, Heroku, Travis CI

## Lessons Learned

This challenge was the first real introduction I had to the MVC pattern, and to databases within a web development context. I was pleased with what I produced with this challenge in particular my takeaway understanding of an MVC. I would be good to implement a feature that users can reply to each other, which would be done by creating an association such as; a comment has many replies.

You can take a look at this app [on heroku here](https://chitterbug.herokuapp.com/)

* Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a user name (e.g. sam@makersacademy.com, s3cr3t, Samuel Russell Hampden Joseph, tansaku).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
* Use bcrypt to secure the passwords.
* Use data mapper and postgres to save the data.
* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* You only can peep if you are logged in.
* Finally submit a pull request before Monday at 9am with your solution or partial solution.  However much or little amount of code you wrote please please please submit a pull request before Monday at 9am
